# TSFXR â€“ Game Sound Effects Generator

Inspired by the amazing [jsfxr](https://github.com/chr15m/jsfxr).

## About

TSFXR is a retro game sound effects generator built with **TypeScript, React, Next.js, shadcn, Tailwind and Zustand**. This passion project was born from my love of game audio and modern web development, bringing classic sfxr-style sound generation to the modern web.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
